<h1>OpenCTI: Researching Malware and APT Groups</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
While working as a SOC analyst, my manager requests research be done into malware and an advanced persistent threat group that our organization believes may pose a threat to our clients. OpenCTI is an open-sourced platform designed to provide organisations with the means to manage CTI through the storage, analysis, visualisation and presentation of threat campaigns, malware and IOCs. I shall use OpenCTI to answer several research inquiries:<br/><br/>
- What is the earliest date recorded related to the CaddyWiper malware?<br/>
- Which attack technique is used by the malware for execution?<br/>
- How many malware relations are linked to this attack technique?<br/>
- Which three tools were used by this Attack Technique in 2016?<br/>
- Which country is the APT37 threat group associated with?<br/>
- Whihc attack techniques are used by this group for gaining initial access?<br/>
